# Welcome to my website!

I do computer things and like cats. A lot.
I blog once in a blue moon, you can find all my posts [here](/post).
In case you want to know more, you can check out my [about me page](/about) and [academic contributions](/publications).
Of course, I also have [GitHub](https://github.com/Arraying).
