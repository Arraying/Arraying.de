# Hello there.

I'm currently interested in compilers and high performance computing.
I occasionally do some things related to systems and artificial intelligence on the side.
In the past, I did some fullstack/DevOps as well.
I enjoy declarative programming, and I'm a big fan of Elixir and Haskell.
However, all roads lead back to C++ and Assembly...

I am pursuing a Master's in Software Engineering of Distributed Systems at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, specializing in data science and high performance computing.
Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from TU Delft.


I have no plans to maintain a portfolio/CV here.
For up to date projects, please visit my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Arraying).
Additionally, I usually post milestones on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ph02/).

To contact me, please reach out to *phubner [at] kth [dot] se*.
