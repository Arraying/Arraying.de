### The basics

I've never been able to properly describe myself so I will just quote my GitHub about me:

> Diving into big data, programming languages and improving productivity and workflow. Formerly part-time full-stack Minecraft Server/Network developer.

Sometimes I feel like a functional programming language.
I really vibe with lazy evaluation.
My pet peeve is wasting time/effort/productivity.

### My goal

The goal of this blog is to explore issues that are facing me as a person and software developer.
Ultimately, I want to talk about my experiences in developing tools for the greater good of consumers and developers.
However, this blog will probably also feature qutie a lot of interesting problems I encountered and how I solved them.


### Languages

Over the years, I've picked up quite a lot of programming languages.
Here's a somewhat comprehensive list of the languages and technologies I've played around with.
By no means am I fluent/proficient in all of these (at the same time).
However, I have solved problems in them.
Should I need to, I will have no problem picking them up again.
